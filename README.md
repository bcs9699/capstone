Objective: 

  The goal of this project is to design and create a portable, automated system to locate and track drones or unmanned aerial vehicles within a designated airspace. The system will automatically locate drones within its set airspace and provide feedback, including heading and location information. The prototype created will work in an indoor environment, with plans to be adjusted for any given environment. The working prototype should be able to satisfy all requirements given a budget of $400.

Background:

In recent years, the rapid increase in drones has introduced significant challenges related to airspace monitoring and security. As drone activity surges, reliable systems to detect and assess potential threats are urgently needed. This challenge is particularly relevant for event operators, law enforcement, and military agencies, who must ensure a safe and secure airspace. Our university, the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), recognizes the importance of addressing these challenges and is supporting the development of an innovative but cost-effective Drone Tracking System. 
This project aims to create a portable, automated system capable of passively locating and tracking drones within a designated airspace. The system's impact extends beyond academic research, with potential applications in commercial sectors for infrastructure monitoring and delivery services, as well as military operations for enhanced surveillance and threat assessment. Through this project, RIT aims to contribute significantly to advancing drone technology and airspace security.
